For hack a thing project for CS98. 

I was exploring how to use props and mapping in React. 

This goal of this project was to use React to learn how to use props, and React mapping. In this project I passed an array of objects as a prop and then used a map to make each object in the array into a div. I then displayed all the in the inner component. Below is a screenshot of what the code looked like.
