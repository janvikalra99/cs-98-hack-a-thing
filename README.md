# cs-98-hack-a-thing
For hack a thing project for CS98. 

This goal of this project was to use React to learn how to use props and React mapping.

In this project in the "App.js" file I passed an array of objects as a prop into the "Ninjas.js" file. In the "Ninja.js" file I then used a map to make each object in the array into a div. In the same file, I then displayed the array of divs. To run this code, simply run it in VSCode. 

I uploaded a screenshot of what the running code looks like. The screenshot file in the repo is called "App Screenshot.jpg"
