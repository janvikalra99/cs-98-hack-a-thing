# cs-98-hack-a-thing
For hack a thing project for CS98. 

This goal of this project was to use React to learn how to use props and React mapping. In this project I passed an array of objects as a prop and then used a map to make each object in the array into a div. I then displayed the array of divs in the inner component. I uploaded a screenshot of what the code looks like.
